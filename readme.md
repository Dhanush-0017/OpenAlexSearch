# Research Paper Analysis Pipeline

Classifies LLM research papers from PDF — extracts key sections and uses a local LLM (Ollama) to classify each paper as **LLM Efficiency**, **LLM Scaling**, or **Other**.

## Setup

**1. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Configure Ollama**

Update these two lines in `pipeline/summarizer.py` to point to your Ollama server:
```python
OLLAMA_URL   = "http://<your-host>:<port>/api/generate"
OLLAMA_MODEL = "gpt-oss:120b"
```

**3. Add PDFs**

Place your research paper PDFs inside `papers/pdf/`.

---

## Running

```bash
python main.py
```

Every run starts completely fresh — all previous output is cleared and every paper is re-processed from scratch.

**What happens:**
1. Scans `papers/pdf/` for PDF files
2. Extracts Title, Abstract, Introduction, Conclusion from each PDF
3. Saves extracted text to `papers/clean_text/<paper_id>.txt`
4. Saves structured chunks to `output/<paper_id>.json`
5. Runs two-stage LLM classification on each paper
6. Writes final results to `results/results.csv` and `results/results.json`

## Output

### results.csv

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `paper_id` | ArXiv ID or filename — use this to look up the paper |
| `title` | Paper title extracted from the PDF |
| `classification` | Category assigned by the LLM |
| `accuracy` | LLM confidence score (0–100%) |
| `justification` | 2–3 sentence explanation of why the paper was classified this way |

### Classification

Papers are classified using a **two-stage** approach:

**Stage 1** — Quick screen:
- `A` = LLM Efficiency
- `B` = LLM Scaling
- `C` = Other

**Stage 2A** (for A/B papers) — Confirms Efficiency vs Scaling with deep reasoning.

**Stage 2B** (for C papers) — Assigns a short label: `Other — Model Architecture`, `Other — Training & Alignment`, etc.

| Category | What it means |
|---|---|
| `LLM Efficiency` | Makes LLMs cheaper, faster, or smaller (quantization, pruning, LoRA, distillation, efficient attention) |
| `LLM Scaling` | Makes LLMs more capable through scale (scaling laws, larger models, emergent abilities) |
| `Other — ...` | Neither efficiency nor scaling — label describes what it actually is |

Papers below **75% confidence** are flagged with `⚑ NEEDS REVIEW` in the terminal.

## Pipeline Modules

### `pipeline/chunker.py`
- Opens PDFs with **PyMuPDF**
- Extracts title using font-size detection (falls back to PDF metadata)
- Extracts Abstract, Introduction, Conclusion using regex with multiple pattern variants and position-based fallbacks
- Warns in the terminal if any section could not be found

### `pipeline/classifier.py`
- Defines the three LLM prompts: `STAGE1_PROMPT`, `STAGE2A_PROMPT`, `STAGE2B_PROMPT`
- Parses LLM responses using regex to handle formatting variations

### `pipeline/summarizer.py`
- Calls Ollama with **temperature=0** (deterministic — same paper always gets the same result)
- Retries up to **3 times** on failure with a 5s delay
- Papers that fail all retries are marked `ERROR` and retried on the next run

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- A running [Ollama](https://ollama.com) instance accessible from your machine
- PDF files placed in `papers/pdf/`
